% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
% "chain of reasoning that led to the question or hypothesis your study addresses"
% Whats in the introduction
This aim of this project is to pilot a experimental environment and analysis pipeline for a planned study on head direction cells in the anterior dorsal nucleus. The neuroscientific background of this study will be introduced concisely to provide a background for understanding the experimental design.


\subsection{Head direction cells of the anterior dorsal nucleus}
% From neuroscientific background to experimental design
% HD cells in anterior thalamic nucleus

% Goal of piloted study
%Goal: Whether and how the anterior dorsal nucleus is involved in spatial episodic memory formation.
%To asses, whether and how the head direction cells of the anterior dorsal nucleus is involved in spatial episodic memory formation

Neurons of the anterios dorsal nucleus are known to contain a subset of cells that are head direction (HD) tuned and form part of a cortical circuit that plays a central role in episodic memory formation. These HD cells are known to provide directional input to downstream hippocampal neurons, functionally linked to memory impairments. In a recent study, \cite{Blanco-Hernndez2024} revealed additional correlations of these HD cells with sensory input to the auditory and somatosensory system, that non-HD-tuned neurons in the anterior dorsal nucleus did not exhibit.
A hypothesis to explain these results is the involvement of these cells in relaying a alert signal during ethologically relevant behaviours, as for example escape of mice from threads percieved via auditory input. Concretely, a role in memory guided reorientation, happening shortly after the onset of this behaviour, is hypothesized.\\

Based on these correlations, a follow-up study now will investigate the \textit{functional} relationship of these HD cells with episodic memory formation by selectively inactivating them by optogenetic tools and resulting behavioural effects in mice. %maybe explain why ethological relevance is important
The goal of this project to prepare the experimental setup and analysis pipeline to conduct that study.



\subsection{Escape behaviour in mice}
% What is escape
Escape behaviour in mice \cite{BrancoEscapeBehavuour2025} is a rapid, stereotyped and ethologically relevant defensive action that is triggered when a sensory stimulus signals imminent danger. Behaviourally, escape typically consists of a brief latency followed by an abrupt initiation of high-speed locomotion, often preceded by a short orienting or freezing phase. Once escape is initiated, mice generate a directed movement that increases distance from the perceived threat and, when available, orientation toward a place of safety. In laboratory paradigms, animals reorient their head and body axis toward a previously learned shelter location, even when the shelter is not visible at the time of threat, indicating that spatial information is rapidly accessed at escape onset. After onset, escape is sustained until the animal reaches shelter, highlighting that escape behaviour is not a reflexive turn-and-run, but a temporally structured sequence comprising fast initiation, goal-directed reorientation, and continued locomotion until safety is achieved.
\\


\subsection{Project description and goal}
%Reorientation accuracy is measured as the difference between the head direction vector and the homing vector of the mouse after reorientation during escape.

The success of the project will be evaluated along two mayor requirements:

First, a environment has to be created, in which escape behaviour in mice can be initiated and recorded. A experimental paradigm closely related is used in \cite{Campagner2023}. Escape behaviour has to be reproduced under this paradigm, with the additional introduction of a modification as will be described down below. Second, a analysis pipeline has to be implemented, that takes these recordings as input and extracts head direction and homing vector along the time axis of individual trials. To allow scaling the analysis to extended periods of time and to multiple animals, pose tracking of these bodyparts has to be automated, to which a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for computer vision is employed. These results will also allow evaluating qualitatively, whether mice in the prepared experimental setup exhibit the behaviour described in the preceding paragraph.



% MATERIALS AND METHODS
\section{Materials and Methods}


\subsection{Experimental setup}
% Arena
All trials were performed in a elevated circular arena made of solid plastic of ~90cm in diameter. In order to constrain the mouse to accessing the memorized shelter location and prevent accessing visual information to estimate the shelter location, it was placed as an underground shelter, barred from sight when the mouse is out in the arena. To achieve this, the shelter was mounted at the border of the arena, so the upper edge aligned with the arena surface, in a modification of the original paradigm used in \cite{Campagner2023}.


%Experimental setup
Data was recorded using Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design Limited), which controlled camera and speakers. Sound stimuli were send by the program after a button press from the experimenter and reached sound pressure levels of 65-80 dB at the centre of the arena. TTL triggers for controlling frames were sent to the camera at a frame rate of 25 per second. Spike2 recordings were exported and converted to .mat format. The camera lens was changed beginning with recordings of mice 5, which resulted in a drop in image resolution due to unresolved hardware issues.

\subsection{Pose tracking}
Pose tracking of left ear, right ear and nose was performed using the software package DeepLabCut 3.0.0rc9(DLC) \cite[]{Nath2019} for Python 3.10 to train a CNN for pose estimation.\\

A training data set of 200 uncropped images, selected by DLC's automatic k-means frames extraction method from recordings of the first three mice, was selected and manually labeled. Importantly, this training set does not yet include mice under the second camera lens introduced in recordings of subsequent mice. DLC offes pretrained weight initialisations with corresponding models fitted to different scenarios of pose tracking. The weight initialisation pretrained to a overhead view of mice (SuperAnimal-TopViewMouse)\cite{Ye_2024} was choosen, in combination with a underlying HRNet-w32 architecture and the default image augmentation method albumentations.\\


Labeling data was performed on a desktop-PC, due to the requirement of a graphical user interface. All subsequent steps for pose tracking were run on the Cluster of the Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, where model fine tuning was performed using a NVIDIA A100 40GB.\\


Pose tracking on a recording yields both the estimated coordinates by the model as well the confidence of the model in this estimation as a scalar in the range of [0, 1]. Frames with confidence score below 0.3 are excluded from the analysis and interpolated in the figures.

\subsection{Homing vector analysis}
Homing vector analysis was run using Python 3.10 and pandas 2.3.3. Due the escape behaviour being only repeatably observable during recording with mice 6, this analysis is only run on for the data of this mouse.

Trials were segmented to contain 1000ms prestimulus and 2000 ms poststimulus intervals, and the corresponding number of frames (6s * 25 frames/s = 150 frames) were extracted per trial. Shelter position was manually determined for each mouse, as its exact pixel position within the frame changed slightly between recording sessions of different mice.

At each timepoint, head center position was calculated as the midpoint between the ears, head direction as the vector from head centre to nose, and homing vector as the vector from head centre to shelter position. The absoloute angular difference (AAD) was defined as the absoloute value of the angle between head direction vector and homing vector, in degrees´.

To select valid trials, angular velocity was determined as the first derivative of the AAD and plotted for each trial. Trials with a notable deflection in angular velocity after stimulus presentation were selected as valid trials, as such a deflection reflects a rapid movement of the head of the mouse, i.e. a reorientation - possibly towards the shelter. 

To asses reorientation accuracy, the AAD of selected valid trials was calculated and plotted - together with the trajectories of the individual valid trials, along the time axis of a trial.

\subsection{Pose estimation}
%\subsubsection{Evaluating quality of pose tracking}
The evaluation of the confidence assigned by the model to its own estimations show medium quality of pose estimation data. These results in \ref{fig:confidencehistograms} from the model trained on data of the first three mice show a clear decline in pose estimation quality after mouse 5, where switching the camera lens caused a change in image resolution.


Figures in Appendix \ref{A} additionally highlight large gaps in the pose estimation data during crucial timespans after stimulus onset for some trials.

\subsection{Selecting escape attempts}
\begin{figure}

	\caption{Angular velocity trajectories for mouse 6. Red vertical line mark stimulus onset. Pronounced deflections after simulus onset indicate rapid reorientation - possibly towards shelter -, a hallmark of escape behaviour in mice. Trials selected as valid escape attempts are marked with a bold black border around the tile. Straight lines represent interpolated data due to pose estimation confidence being below 0.3 at these timepoints. Missing data means there was no data above 0.3 confidence after that timepoint to interpolate.}
	\label{fig:angularvelocity}
\end{figure}



Figure \ref{fig:angularvelocity} shows all trials of mouse 6 and the trajectories of head angular velocity. Notable deflections in angular velocity indicate rapid head movement in the plane parallel to the floor, corresponding to a change of head direction are present in trials 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 13.

\subsection{High reorientation accuracy at escape initiation}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{reorientation_error_angle}
	\caption{Error angle, defined as difference between head direction and homing vector during escape trials of mouse 6. Red vertical line mark stimulus onset. Thin green lines represent individual valid trials, thick green line mean of valid trials. Straight lines represent interpolated data due to pose estimation confidence being below 0.3 at these timepoints. Missing data means there was no data above 0.3 confidence after that timepoint to interpolate.}
	\label{fig:reorientationerrorangle}
\end{figure}

Data from mouse 6 demonstrates in a ostensive manner the accuracy (Figure \ref{fig:reorientationerrorangle}
) with which the mouse reorients itself towards the shelter, presumably relying solely on episodic  in calculating the required reorientation angle. The difference between homing vector and head direction (error angle) drops below 2° in the time window from 600 - 800ms after stimulus onset in every preselected trial. Notably, the error angle increases again after the initial reorientation in some of the trials.

% DISCUSSION
\section{Discussion}
This pilot study aimed to set up a experimental environment and analysis pipeline for a upcoming study of escape behaviour in mice. Data of the most recent mouse demonstrated a successfull run from beginning to start under this setup and the applicability of the analysis pipeline for automated pose estimation.

The possibility remains that mouse 6 simply easily scared and subsequent mice will react with the same low escape probabilty. Whether this high reliablity in triggering escape behaviour with the white noise stimulus can be reproduced in other mice remains to be tested. 

The pose estimation model achieves very good performance on data recorded with the same image quality and lens settings as its training data. For mouse 5 and 6, the drop in pose estimation confidence underscores, that it is however not robust to a change in the recording setup as implemented starting from mouse 5. To achieve a reliably high quality of estimations, it is required to train another pose estimation model with data recorded under the final recording setup.\\

Mouse 6 demonstrated very high reorientation accuracy towards the shelter during escape. The study on head direction cells of the anterior dorsal nucleus aims to selectively inhibit these cells. The high reorientation accuracy without inhibition allows data from mice without these cells inhibited to serve as a baseline for establishing a functional relationship between HD cells and and alterations in memory guided reotientation during escape.

\section{LLM usage in writing}
Section 1.2. is based on manual editing of the answer of the follwing prompt to ChatGPT based on GPT-5.2 supplied with \cite{BrancoEscapeBehavuour2025}:
"on the basis of this article, write a short scientific introductory paragraph to a lab report. the paragraph should focus on explaining how escape behaviour in mice "looks like" and on the reorientation towards the shelter as well as timing. do not include information about brain circuits"\\

Answer: Escape behaviour in mice is a rapid, stereotyped defensive action that is triggered when a sensory stimulus signals imminent danger. Behaviourally, escape typically consists of a brief latency followed by an abrupt initiation of high-speed locomotion, often preceded by a short orienting or freezing phase. Once escape is initiated, mice generate a directed movement that increases distance from the threat and is commonly biased toward a place of safety rather than simply away from the stimulus. In laboratory paradigms, animals reliably reorient their body axis toward a previously learned shelter location, even when the shelter is not visible at the time of threat, indicating that spatial information is rapidly accessed at escape onset. The timing of escape is tightly linked to threat imminence: stimuli that rapidly approach or cross a critical proximity threshold evoke responses with latencies on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, whereas weaker or more ambiguous threats delay initiation. After onset, escape is sustained until the animal reaches shelter, highlighting that escape behaviour is not a reflexive turn-and-run, but a temporally structured sequence comprising fast initiation, goal-directed reorientation, and continued locomotion until safety is achieved
